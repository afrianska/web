I will briefly introduce the Lean UX canvas. This canvas is typically used when designing a product using the Lean UX approach. Lean UX canvas has 8 main boxes that have to be filled. Let's get started to fill each box.

## Box 1: Business problem
&#128073; ***What problem does the business have that you are trying to solve?***

For Lean UX to be successful, the team must be given a problem to solve, not a solution to build. To gain a better understanding of the problem, we can formulate a business problem statement. Before writing a business problem statement, the first thing we have to do is clarify the context to the product manager or stakeholder whether the project is worth to continue or not by interview some questions, included:
- What have we observed and measured that leads us to believe there's a problem/issue?
- Who are we targeting with this work?
- How does this piece of work fit into the broader program of work the company is undertaking?
- What is the impact of fixing (or not fixing) this problem on company health?

If the project is worth it, we will continue to create a business problem statement, but remember that your initial efforts are likely to be filled with assumptions. You will discover that this is going to be true for every part of the Lean UX canvas. Inevitabily, some of these assumptions will be wrong, so the goal of Box 1 isn't writing the perfect problem statement. The goal is to begin to build alignment within the team about where you're headed on this initiative and how you'll know you've achieved the goal.

**The business problem statement has to answer three fundamental questions:**
1. What are the current goals of the product or the system the team is working on?
2. What's changed in the world, and how has that negatively affected the product?
3. What's an explicit request to improve the product?

**Format you could use to create business problem statement:**

***[Our service/product]** was designed to achieve **[these business/customer goals and deliver this value]**. We have observed **[in these ways]** that the product/service isn't meeting these goals, which is causing **[this adverse effect/problem]** to our business.*

*How might we improve service/product so that our customers are more successful as determined by **[these measurable changes in their behavior]**?*

The success criteria (goals) in a problem statement are high-level, tend to be key performance indicators or impact metrics, the things that are found on executive dashboards. These could be metrics like revenue, profit, cost of goods sold, and customer satisfaction.

Don't specify the solution. We often see teams inserting solutions into the problem statement, this often shows up in the *"How might we"* part of the statement with phrases such as *"How might we implement a mobile app that solves for this..."* solution should not be in the statement at all.

## Box 2: Business outcomes
&#128073; ***How will you know you solved the business problem? What will you measure?***

We can determine whether our solution has successfully solved the problem by using metrics (including KPIs) such as Conversion Rate, Retention Rate, Net Promoter Score (NPS), Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR), Customer Satisfaction Score (CSAT), Daily Active Users (DAU) / Monthly Active Users (MAU) Ratio, etc.

Before selecting relevant metrics and tools, we should answer: ***"What will people be doing differently if our solution works?"*** Every option in the brainstorm awswers should begin with a verb, and each answer should reflect one of three categories:
1. Something valuable that customers do in the system already,
2. Something undesirable that we would like them to do less of, or 
3. Something new that we believe would be beneficial and encourage them to start doing.

This helps us choose appropriate tools or frameworks for the metrics, like Pirate Metrics (AARRR), Conversion Funnels, Experience Journey Maps, Hook Model, etc., where every framework or tool has a different focus.

The example answers:

- *"Recommend the platform to current small businesses around the school"*, the potential metric we can choose: Net Promoter Score (NPS), with framework: Pirate Metrics (AARRR).

- *"Used the platform without complaint about any unfair partnering vendors"*, the potential metric we can choose: Customer Satisfaction Score (CSAT), with framework: Experience Journey Maps


Increase satisfaction of platform and program to 80% by small businesses around school.
"Achieve a CSAT of 80% for the platform among small businesses around school by Q4 2025, up from 60%, to drive increased adoption"

## Box 3: Users
***What types (i.e., persons) of users and customers should you focus on first?***

Build proto-persona (not persona).

## Box 4: User outcomes & benefits
***Why would your users seek out your product or service? What benefit would they gain from using it? What behavior change can we observe that tells us they've achieved their goal?***

Listing the benefits

## Box 5: Solution
***What can we make that will solve our business problem and meet the needs of our customers at the same time? List product, feature, or enhancement ideas here.***

Generate possible solutions.

## Box 6: Hypothesis
***Combine the assumptions from 2, 3, 4 & 5 into the following hypothesis statement: “We believe that [business outcome] will be achieved if [user] attains [benefit] with [feature].”hat goals (qual & quant) do we have for this project?***

Gather all information on bx 2,3,4,5 to be list of hypothesis.

## Box 7: Decide the most important thing we need to learn first.
***For each hypothesis from Box 6, identify its riskiest assumption. Then, determine the riskiest one. This is the assumption that will cause the entire idea to fail if it’s wrong.***

Use the Hypothesis Prioritization Canvas to pick the riskiest to learn first.

## Box 8: MVPs and Experiment
***MVPs and Experiments. Design experiments to learn as fast as you can whether your riskiest assumption is true or false.***

This box is where we create prototypes and experiment.
